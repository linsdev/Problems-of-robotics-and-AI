<h3 align="center">Problems of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p align="justify">
Since ancient times, humanity has sought to create mechanical friends for itself. Only at the end of the last century, we managed to get closer to that dream. However, there remains the problem of artificial intelligence. The difficulty in creating an intelligent machine is the lack of a clear understanding of the nature and objective of the thinking process.
</p>
<p align="justify">
What are consciousness, thinking, and intelligence? To create the AI vital to describe these terms because they define the very essence of AI. A building AI process should begin with a clear definition of these concepts, and the need for their presence at AI.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Consciousness reflects a position of AI owner in the environment, the definition of itself as an object with the specific properties relative to the objects of the world. The AI owner identifies itself as some object performing some actions. Consciousness is directly dependent on the knowledge of the world and its objects' properties, i.e. the knowledge databases filling about the environment. This is all reflected in the processing of the events from the outer world and the self, and a report on these events.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The thinking is the process of problem-solving, posed before AI, based on native algorithms. Intelligence – decision-making mechanism based on the analysis of some objects' properties involved in the task.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Which of these properties is necessary for AI? The concept of "intelligence" and "thinking" are interrelated and vital for AI. But does it need "consciousness"? It all depends on the assigned tasks. The expert system does not need to be conscious, but for a robot, which interacts with humans, is required consciousness.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Developers seek to create an AI similar to the human mind. However, besides the real problems, it isn't without solve some philosophical and ethical points. As in every idea, AI with consciousness has many supporters and opponents. The main problem here is the problem of the further evolutionary development of humanity. Creating a robot that can think and act like a human, would lead to a logical evolutionary deadlock, and possible collapse of human civilization. Why need people if they could successfully replace with machines?
</p>
<p align="justify">
The main difficulty of creating full AI is the impossibility of describing the operation only by using mathematical algorithms, we also need fuzzy logic and neural networks, which difficult to implement. Great difficulties arise in the organization of storing and processing large amounts of information in the database for AI.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Thus, even after substantial time, mankind will learn to create only a powerful machine, which is not even looking at the possibility of emulating the mind, to be far removed from human thinking. In any case, creating algorithms for logical thinking is necessary, because this is our future.
